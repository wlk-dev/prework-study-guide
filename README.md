# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Whenever you are starting something new it's nice to have a place to write down some key points for later reference. By building this webpage I was able to learn the basics of setting up a webapp and deploying it to a webpage, while also being able to have a place that I can come back and reference information that I have learned.
