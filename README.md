# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Whever you are starting something new it's nice to have a place to write down some key points for later reference. By building this webpage I was able to learn the basics of setting up a webapp and deploying it to a webpage, while also being able to have a place that I can come back and reference information that I have learned.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains some basic notes about the indicated topic. For a suggestion on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
